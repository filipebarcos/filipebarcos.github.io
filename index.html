          Hi. I'm Filipe Costa, software engineer for the past 7+ years, father for the past 2 months and beer drinker for the past 10 years (very experienced!).
        </p>
        <p>
          In my early days as an engineered I spent a lot of time with Java and C#. Did some Android development too, but later on, I met Ruby and Rails, my life changed. Nowadays I still spend most of my time hacking Ruby code, but I've being experiencing with a few other languages like JavaScript and it's bazilion number of frameworks and libraries, Rust, Elixir, very, very little of Go and more recently now, Crystal.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I find some free time between work and parenting, I try to help my local and remote community. I organize <a href="http://guru-ce.github.io">Guru-CE</a>, a Ruby Meetup in Fortaleza, Brazil, also give some help on <a href="https://www.devbeers.io">DevBeers Fortaleza</a>, and, finally, I try to give a hand to the people behind <a href="http://remotemeetup.com/">Remote Meetup</a>.
