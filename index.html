          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>
            Hi. I'm Filipe Costa, software engineer for the past 7+ years, father, and beer drinker for the past 10 years (very experienced!).
          </p>
          <p>
            In my early days as an engineer I spent a lot of time with Java and C#. Did some Android development too, but later on, I met Ruby and Rails, my life changed. Nowadays I still spend most of my time hacking Ruby code, but I've being experiencing with a few other languages like JavaScript and its bazilion number of frameworks and libraries, Rust, Elixir and very, very little of Go.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I find some free time between work and parenting, I try to help my local and remote community. I organize <a href="http://guru-ce.github.io" target="_blank">Guru-CE</a>, a Ruby Meetup in Fortaleza, Brazil, also give some help on <a href="https://www.devbeers.io" target="_blank">DevBeers Fortaleza</a>.

          <p>
            As a software engineer at Ride, I worked in a few different teams, trying to accomplish one goal, reinvet how people commute.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was, initialy brought to integrate the Billing team, where we had a small ruby service running all integrations with Stripe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aftewards, I integrated the API team, where we had a major code, a Rails app, using JSON-API standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I had the opportunity to integrate the Android Team for a short period, it was nice to have this experience again, after a long time (first, and last, time I did android development it was on version 1.5).
          </p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a></h3>
          <h5>Consultant Developer, jul/2012 - may/2013</h5>
          <p>
            As a consultant in ThoughtWorks, I joined my first Ruby project (actually using JRuby) and no Rails. It was great time to improve my Ruby skills. I was working in a real time auction web site for a major enterprise in US.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the first project was successfully delivered, I pivoted to a large legacy Rails application, which was around since Rails 0.x. We had to handle a lot of interesting problems, from upgrading old Rails version to manage a large amount of data and requests.
