		<h2> Hi, I'm Filipe Costa </h2>
		<p> Developer at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, living in Recife, Brazil. </p>
		<p> Many people ask me "What language do you use to develop?", today I'm working in a project with JRuby, Sinatra and JQuery (mostly), integrating with a Rails app.</p>
		<p> I like to learn different languages but nowadays I'm still in love with Ruby, and still willing to learn a lot. </p>
