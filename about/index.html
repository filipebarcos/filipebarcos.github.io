		<h1> Hi, I'm Filipe Costa </h1>
		<p> Developer at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, living in Recife, Brazil. Many people ask "What language do you use to develop?".</p>
		<p> Today I'm working in a project with JRuby, Sinatra and JQuery (mostly), integrating with a Rails app. </p>
		<p> I like to learn different languages but nowadays I'm still in love with Ruby, and still willing to learn a lot. </p>
